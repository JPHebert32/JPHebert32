### EXPERIENCED DATA ANALYST WITH RIGOROUS TRAINING ACROSS PYTHON & JAVASCRIPT
### Profile
I am passionate about the power of data to improve nearly everything in the world, from climate change to transportation to all business outcomes. I am a self-starter but also enjoy working closely with others to analyze, model, and visualize data in ways that create impactful change in business decisions. 

Over the past decade, I worked closely with data scientists analyzing and executing high-frequency trade programs coded in Python. I found this work to be exciting and was inspired to learn more advanced technologies. Consequently, I completed 24 weeks of rigorous, fast-paced, advanced education in a Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp at the University of Denver. There, I focused on practical technical skills where I gained expertise in technologies such as Excel, Python, JavaScript, SQL Databases, APIs, Git/Github, and Tableau. 

This bootcamp culminated with a practicum with an AI company, where I effectively applied Machine Learning models while working on a real-world manufacturing client project. 

Now, I am actively exploring new opportunities in which I can leverage my experience and training to help an organization gain insightful, data-driven business intelligence.

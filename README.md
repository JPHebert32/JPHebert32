### EXPERIANCED DATA ANALYST WITH RIGOROUS TRAINING ACROSS PYTHON & JAVASCRIPT
### Profile
I have years of experience at a proprietary trading firm, culminating with a position as a trade-floor operator in a supervisory role. In this position, I worked closely with talented data scientists and became familiar with technologies such as Python, which our team used to execute and optimize our trading strategies. I also became an expert in Excel and working with large datasets. In September 2020, I completed advanced education that builds on my experience with data technologies. I look forward to a challenging new role helping an organization leverage data to improve outcomes.
